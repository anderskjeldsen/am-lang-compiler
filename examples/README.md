### üß™ **unit-testing** ‚≠ê **FEATURED**
**Comprehensive testing framework** showcasing v0.6.4's major features:

#### **Basic Testing**
- `test` keyword for defining test functions
- Professional test execution with `[STARTING]`/`[PASSED]`/`[FAILED]` output
- Test class organization and structure

#### **Mocking Framework** üéØ
- **`mock` keyword** for overriding class behavior
- **Nested mocking** with automatic cleanup
- **Scope management** using `scope { }` blocks
- **Sequential mocking** with proper state isolation

#### **Advanced Testing Patterns**
- **Mock performance testing** - validating mock overhead
- **Edge case testing** - handling error conditions
- **Complex scenarios** - multi-class mocking with dependencies

**Key Test Files:**
- `CalculatorTest.aml` - Basic testing patterns
- `CalculatorMockTest.aml` - Introduction to mocking
- `NestedMocksTest.aml` - Advanced nested mock scenarios
- `MockPerformanceTest.aml` - Performance validation
- `ComplexMockScenariosTest.aml` - Real-world testing patterns

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running Examples

### Prerequisites
Make sure AmLang is installed:
```bash
# One-line installation
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anderskjeldsen/am-lang-compiler/master/scripts/install-amlc.sh | bash

# Verify installation
amlc --version
```

### Running an Example
```bash
# Navigate to any example directory
cd examples/hello-world

# Build and run
amlc build
amlc run

# Or build and run in one step
amlc build && ./hello-world
```

### Running Tests (unit-testing example)
```bash
cd examples/unit-testing

# Run all tests
amlc test

# Run specific test class
amlc test CalculatorTest

# Run specific test method
amlc test CalculatorTest.testAddition

# Run mock-related tests
amlc test CalculatorMockTest NestedMocksTest
```

## üéØ Learning Path

### 1. **Start with Basics**
```bash
cd examples/hello-world
amlc run
```

### 2. **Learn Language Features**
```bash
cd examples/loop-keyword-demo  
amlc run
```

### 3. **Explore Testing (RECOMMENDED)**
```bash
cd examples/unit-testing
amlc test                    # See basic testing
amlc test CalculatorMockTest # Experience mocking
```

### 4. **Build Real Applications**
```bash
cd examples/file-browser     # GUI applications
amlc run
```
