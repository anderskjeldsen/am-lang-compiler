# Loop Keyword Demo

This example demonstrates the usage of the `loop` keyword in AmLang.

The `loop` keyword creates an infinite loop. It does not take any parameters or conditions. The only way to exit a `loop` is by using a `break` or `return` statement inside the loop body.

## Example
See `src/am-lang/Example/Program.aml` for a simple loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5 and exits using `break`.
